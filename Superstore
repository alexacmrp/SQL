#For this project, I used SQL to query the Superstore database to get information about items sold at the store and their prices. 

#Used a SELECT statement to order the items by price.

SELECT item_name, price
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price desc;

#Statistic about the item prices.

SELECT avg(price)
FROM superstore;

#Statistic about the price for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies". 

SELECT avg(price)
FROM superstore
WHERE category="Kitchen Supplies"
